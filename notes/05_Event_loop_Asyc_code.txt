1.Event Driven
2.Single Threaded
3.V8 vs Libuv

5.Event Loop
6.Async code 
7.Blocking code

6.1 Event Driven
	On. data
	On. End 
	user-> click ->Event Listener -> Event Queue -> Event Loop -> Event handler

6.2 single Threaded
	
	Request,event -> Event Loop (single work data) -> Thread Pool (WorkerThread(maindata))
	
	Main work : Event Loop karse 
	File System,database file -> WorkerThread karse
	opration completed thay pachu event loop jay 
	pachi event loop trigger callback : req jay

6.3 V8 Vs Libuv
	V8:
	1. open-source Javascipt engine by google.
	2. Used in Chrome and node.js
	3. comiles Javascript To native Machine code.
	4. Ensure high-performance Javascript Execution.

	libuv:
	1. multi-platform support library for node.js
	2. Handles asnchronous i/o operation.
	3. Provide Event-driven architecture.
	4. manegs file-system,networking and timers non-blocking across platforms.

6.4 Node Runtime 

	An invoked funtion in added to the call stack. once it return a value, it 	is popped off.
	
6.5 Event Loop
	timers: this phase executes callbacks scheduled by setTimeout() and 
		setInterval().
	● pending callbacks: executes I/O callbacks 
		deferred to the next loop iteration.
	● idle, prepare: only used internally.
	● poll: retrieve new I/O events; execute I/O related callbacks (almost all 		with the exception of close callbacks, the ones scheduled by 
		timers, and setImmediate()); node will block here when 		appropriate.
	● check: setImmediate() callbacks are invoked here.
	● close callbacks: some close callbacks, e.g. 
		socket.on('close', ...).

6.6 Async Code
